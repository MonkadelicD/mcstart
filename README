## README - mcstart

# Overview
mcstart is a simple shell script used to start minecraft servers.
It supports a specific directory structure but works with a variety of
Minecraft server jars.

# Requirements
Packages: Minecraft server application, screen, java (at least version
8 and 17 according to my testing)

# Directory Structure
place mcstart script in whatever directory you prefer that is included
in your $PATH.
mcstart expects each minecraft server jar to be located in $HOME in a 
directory named the same as the server software name, ie forge, paper,
spigot, vanilla, pixelmon, fabric etc.
Within the server directory there should be a directory for each version
of Minecraft, ie 1.12.2, 1.17.1, 1.19.2, 1.19.3, etc.

For Forge server the script will always use the run.sh script.

For Spigot, Paper, Fabric, and Vanilla the server jar should be named
by the server type and version like spigot-1.17.1.jar

The directory structure should resemble the following tree:

forge
├── 1.17.1
│   ├── forge-1.17.1-37.0.95-installer.jar
│   └── run.sh
├── 1.19.2
│   ├── forge-1.19.2-43.2.0-installer.jar
│   └── run.sh
├── 1.19.3
│   ├── forge-1.19.3-44.1.0-installer.jar
│   └── run.sh
└── current -> 1.19.3

spigot
├── 1.17.1
│   └── spigot-1.17.1.jar
├── 1.19.3
│   └── spigot-1.19.3.jar
└── current -> 1.19.3

For Forge servers, run the java installer from within the directory
corresponding to the Minecraft version.

Once the server is running use screen -ls to list running screen
sessions. Then use "screen -r <name-of-screen-session>" to connect to
the server console.

To start your server use the following syntax:
# mcstart <server-type> <version>

Example
# mcstart forge 1.19.3
